                    Hi, my name is Prutha and I am a 12 year old coder.
                    I recently started coding about 7 months ago. 
                    I code around four to five hours a week.
                    Some other things that I like to do are badminton, play with my friends, and play clarinet.
                    I play badminton about 30 hours a week and 6 days a week. 
                    I am currently in my school band and I play the Bb clarinet. 
                    I started playing about 1.5 years ago and I practice five times a week.
                    I hope you enjoy my first website!
                </p>
